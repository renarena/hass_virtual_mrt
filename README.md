## 🙏 Thanks
I ported this logic from a blueprint that [@Ecronika](https://github.com/Ecronika) [shared in the Home Assistant Community Forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/blueprint-virtual-mrt-v0-1-10-mean-radiant-temperature-operative-temperature/945267/3)

## 📝 Note
There is already a custom integration named ['Thermal Comfort' ](https://github.com/dolezsa/thermal_comfort) that uses air temp and relative humidity to expose some perception sensors alongside dew point, frost point and heat index/humidex.
This integration is different in that it focuses on **Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT)** and **Operative Temperature ($T_{op}$)**, which are more advanced concepts from building science that better represent how humans perceive temperature in a space based on the surrounding surfaces and air movement.

## 🏡 Introduction: What This Integration Does

This integration brings a professional building science concept—**Thermal Comfort**—into Home Assistant. Instead of just showing the air temperature, this tool creates a **Virtual Room Device** that calculates how hot or cold a person *actually feels*.

* **Standard Thermometer:** Measures Air Temperature ($T_{air}$). 🌡️
* **Virtual Sensor:** Measures **Operative Temperature** ($T_{op}$), which is the most accurate single metric for human comfort, accounting for air temperature, the radiant heat from surrounding surfaces, and air velocity.

This is achieved by computing the **Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT)**, which tracks the temperature of the walls, windows, and ceiling based on outside weather and sun exposure. ☀️

## 💡 Why MRT and $T_{op}$ Are Useful

| Sensor                        | Definition                                                                         | Use in HASS                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Radiant Temp (MRT)**   | The effective temperature of the room's surfaces (walls, windows, floor, ceiling). | Essential for **monitoring radiant systems** (floor heating/cooling). It allows you to see the **thermal lag** of your home's structure. 🐌                                                                  |
| **Operative Temp ($T_{op}$)** | The weighted average of the Air Temperature and the MRT.                           | **The ultimate trigger for HVAC automation.** Use $T_{op}$ instead of $T_{air}$ to ensure your heating/cooling system only runs when a person *feels* uncomfortable, saving energy and improving comfort. 🎯 |

## 🏠 Room Configuration: Profiles and Inputs

This integration exposes a **Virtual Device** for each room you configure. This device contains the calculated $T_{op}$ and MRT sensors, along with a set of configurable **Number Inputs** to fine-tune the model to your home's unique physical characteristics.

### 1. The Core Configurable Inputs (Profiles)

The calculation relies on **four primary configurable inputs** (number entities) that represent the structural qualities of your room.

| Input Name                                     | Layman's Explanation                                                                                                                                      | Value Range   | Example by Home Type                                                                      |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exterior Envelope Ratio** ($f_{\text{out}}$) | **Exterior Wall Share.** How much of the room's total interior surface area touches the outside or an unconditioned space (like an attic or cold garage). | $0.0 - 1.0+$  | **0.15:** Interior apartment room. **0.80:** Corner room. **0.95:** Top-floor attic room. |
| **Window Share** ($f_{\text{win}}$)            | **Window Ratio.** The percentage of the exterior wall area that is glass.                                                                                 | $0.0 - 1.0$   | **0.10:** Small basement window. **0.50:** Large picture window/patio door. 🖼️           |
| **Insulation Loss Factor** ($k_{\text{loss}}$) | **Heat Leakage / U-Value.** How poorly insulated your walls and windows are, influencing heat loss in winter. (Higher value = worse insulation).          | $0.05 - 0.30$ | **0.10:** Modern, well-insulated home. **0.25:** Old, uninsulated walls.                  |
| **Solar Gain Factor** ($k_{\text{solar}}$)     | **Solar Heating Power.** How much solar energy actually passes through your windows to heat the room (often called SHGC).                                 | $0.0 - 2.0$   | **0.8:** Standard clear glass. **1.5:** Tilted skylight/very large clear windows.         |

### 2. Thermal Smoothing Factor ($\alpha$)

This input is critical for accurately modeling the room's **thermal inertia** (thermal mass).

| Input Name                              | Purpose                                                                                            | Suggested Range                      | Example by Home Type                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|:----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Thermal Smoothing Factor** ($\alpha$) | Controls **how quickly** the calculated MRT responds to changes in outside conditions (sun, wind). | $0.05$ (Slowest) to $0.95$ (Fastest) | A North American 1950's wood-frame house has **low thermal mass**. You would use a **higher $\alpha$** (e.g., $0.40$ – $0.60$). A German home with thick masonry walls would use a **lower $\alpha$** (e.g., $0.05$ – $0.20$). |

#### Update Behavior
* When you **edit the $\alpha$ factor**, the change is **immediate** for the next calculation cycle.
* However, the effect of the change on the sensor reading ($\text{MRT}_{\text{final}}$) will be **gradual** because the smoothing formula is designed to integrate the new value slowly with the existing history. You will not see the MRT instantly jump.

### 3. Profile Management

The integration allows you to save a library of custom profiles per room.

* **Profile Selector:** The `select.profile` entity lists all default profiles and any custom profiles you save.
* **Save/Delete:** Use the `text.profile_name` input and the `button.save_profile` / `button.delete_profile` entities to manage your library.
* **"Unsaved Custom Profile" State:** If you select a default profile and manually change any of the four number inputs, the `select.profile` entity will automatically switch its state to **"Unsaved Custom Profile"** (this is your working scratchpad). 💾
    * You can then input a profile name and save it as a new custom profile.
    * There is a cap of **100 custom profiles** per device (aka room).

## 🌬️ Dynamic Comfort Factors ($T_{op}$ Modifiers)

The integration uses several optional inputs to dynamically calculate the effective Air Speed ($v_{\text{air}}$) and adjust the Mean Radiant Temperature ($\text{MRT}$) based on user actions (opening a window, turning on a fan, or activating radiant heat).

>[!NOTE]
> The optional climate entity is only used to detect if the HVAC system is actively heating, cooling, or running the fan. It does not read or modify the target temperature or mode.

### 1. Air Speed ($v_{\text{air}}$) Logic

The final Air Speed ($v_{\text{air}}$) is used to determine the $T_{\text{op}}$ Convective Weighting Factor ($A_{\text{Radiant}}$). The logic uses a **"Max Wins"** approach—it calculates potential air speeds from all sources and uses the highest one.

| Input | Speed Contribution |
|:---|:---|
| **Door State Sensor** | If `on`: **0.8 m/s** (Drafty). |
| **Window State Sensor** | If `on`: **0.5 m/s** (Breezy). |
| **HVAC Climate Entity** | If `hvac_action` is active (heating/cooling/fan): Uses the **HVAC Airflow Speed** setting (default 0.4 m/s). *Ignored if "Radiant Heating" is enabled.* |
| **Fan Entity** | Uses mapped speed (`low`: 0.3, `med`: 0.5, `high`: 0.8). |
| **Manual Air Speed** | Uses the value set by the user (if > 0.1). |
| **Default** | **0.1 m/s** (Still Air Baseline). |

### 2. Radiant Heating Model

If you have in-floor heating or radiators, the logic adapts.

* **"Is Radiant Heating?" Checkbox:** (In Config/Options Flow). If checked, the integration assumes the heating system warms the *surfaces* (MRT) rather than blowing air.
* **Behavior:** When `heating` is active:
    1.  **Air Speed:** Remains low (Still Air).
    2.  **MRT Boost:** The calculated MRT is boosted based on the **Radiant Surface Temperature** target you set (e.g., 26°C for a warm floor).
    3.  **Thermal Capacitor:** The boost is smoothed to simulate the slow heat-up and cool-down of the slab or radiator (configurable via **Radiant System Type** select).

### 3. Shading Factor

* **Shading Entity:** Accepts a Cover, Binary Sensor, or Input Number.
* **Effect:** If the blinds are closed (0%), the Solar Gain term is multiplied by 0.0, stopping solar heating in the calculation. If 50% open, solar gain is cut by half.

## 📡 External Data Sources and Fallbacks

The MRT calculation is reactive, meaning it constantly adjusts based on real-time weather conditions. For this, it pulls data from the **Weather Entity**, **`sun.sun`** and the optional **Global Solar Radiation Sensor**.

| Data Point                       | Source                                                       | Use in Calculation                                                                                                                                                             |
|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Outdoor Air Temp ($T_{out}$)** | `weather` entity attribute (`temperature`)                   | Calculates the **Heat Loss Term** (how much heat escapes through the walls).                                                                                                   |
| **Apparent Temperature**         | `weather` entity attribute (`apparent_temperature`)          | Used to determine effective heat loss. If Apparent Temp is **lower** than $T_{out}$ (due to **wind chill**), the lower value is used for a more accurate loss calculation. 🌬️ |
| **Wind Speed / Wind Gust**       | `weather` entity attribute (`wind_speed`, `wind_gust_speed`) | Calculates the **Wind Effect Factor** (convective loss). Higher wind speed increases the heat loss from the exterior envelope.                                                 |
| **Cloud Coverage / UV Index**    | `weather` entity attributes or dedicated `sensor`            | Used to estimate **Global Solar Radiation** (Solar Gain).                                                                                                                      |
| **Precipitation / Condition**    | `weather` entity state (`rainy`, `snowy`, etc.)              | Used to apply a **Rain Multiplier** (penalty) to the solar gain, simulating dark, wet conditions that reduce radiation transmission.                                           |
| **Sun Elevation**                | Home Assistant's `sun.sun` entity                            | Determines the **Daylight Factor**, used as a multiplier for solar gain when the sun is below the horizon.                                                                     |
| **Sun Azimuth**                  | Home Assistant's `sun.sun` entity                            | Calculates the **Solar Angle of Incidence Factor**, used to determine how the sun is hitting the window                                                                        |
| **Global Solar Radiation**       | Optional dedicated `sensor` (e.g., `sensor.solar_radiation`) | **Preferred source** for solar gain calculation. Bypasses all weather heuristics if available (will log a warning on values > `1300 W/m²`, but will still use it).             |

>[!NOTE]
> For best results, use a **physical Total Solar Radiation Sensor** (W/m²). These
> sensors provide the most accurate measurement of solar radiation impacting your home.
> If no sensor is supplied, the integration will intelligently estimate irradiance
> using weather data, but cap it at `1000 W/m²`.

#### Virtual Global Solar Radiation Sensor
I don't have a physical one, so instead, I created a virtual sensor using the HASS built-in
[Forcast.Solar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/forecast_solar) integration. **YOU MUST** use `1000` as your
`total watt peak power` and `0` as your `declination angle` to get correct W/m² output for Global Horizontal
Irradiation (GHI), I left the default `azimuth` of `180`.

I take the output sensor `Estimated power production - now` convert it's value directly to W/m² by using a
HASS helper template sensor and setting its `device_class` to `irradiation` and `unit_of_measurement` to `W/m²`.
If the sensor outputs `123 W`, it is converted to `123 W/m²` and the template sensor is used as the dedicated Global Solar
Radiation Sensor in this integration.

## 🧠 Advanced Section: The Calculation Flow

The Mean Radiant Temperature ($\text{MRT}_{\text{final}}$) calculation is a three-step process executed whenever an input sensor changes state:

1.  **Convective Weighting ($A_{\text{Radiant}}$):** The system first calculates the Radiant Weighting Factor ($A_{\text{Radiant}}$) based on the derived Air Speed ($v_{\text{air}}$) using ASHRAE simplified coefficients ($h_c$ and $h_r$):
    $$A_{\text{Radiant}} = \frac{h_r}{h_c + h_r}$$

2.  **Instantaneous Calculation ($\text{MRT}_{\text{calc}}$):** The physics model determines the raw temperature jump. The $\text{Solar}_{\text{term}}$ is multiplied by the **Shading Factor**, and the **Radiant Boost** is added if heating is active.

$$
\text{MRT}_{\text{calc}} = T_{\text{air}} - \underbrace{\text{Loss}_{\text{term}}}_{\text{Heat escaping outside}} + \underbrace{\text{Solar}_{\text{term}} \times \text{Shade}_{\text{Factor}}}_{\text{Net heat entering windows}} + \underbrace{\text{Radiant}_{\text{Boost}}}_{\text{Active heat source}}
$$

3.  **Clamping & Smoothing:** The result is clamped to realistic bounds and smoothed by the Thermal Smoothing Factor ($\alpha$). $\text{MRT}_{\text{final}}$ is the result.

$$
\text{MRT}_{\text{final}} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{MRT}_{\text{prev}} + \alpha \times \text{MRT}_{\text{clamped}}
$$

4.  **Operative Temperature ($T_{op}$):** The final reported temperature uses the dynamic weighting derived in step 1.

$$
T_{\text{op}} = A_{\text{Radiant}} \cdot \text{MRT}_{\text{final}} + (1 - A_{\text{Radiant}}) \cdot T_{\text{air}}
$$

## 💧 Psychrometric & Moisture Data (Optional)

If you configure a **Relative Humidity (RH) Sensor** in the integration settings, the device will automatically calculate and expose 7 additional advanced sensors. These are critical for holistic home health monitoring, mold prevention, and summer comfort control.

### 1. Enabling Psychrometrics
* **How to Enable:** In the Config Flow (or via "Configure"), select a sensor for **Relative Humidity Source**.
* **Result:** The integration immediately initializes the following sensors for that room.

### 2. Sensor Descriptions & Use Cases

| Sensor                     | Unit    | What it tells you                                            | Best Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:---------------------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dew Point** ($T_{dp}$)   | °C      | The temperature at which condensation forms.                 | **Mold Prevention.** If $T_{dp}$ approaches the temperature of your walls/windows, you are at risk of mold. Keep indoor $T_{dp} < 18°C$ in summer to avoid "stickiness."                                                      |
| **Frost Point** ($T_{fp}$) | °C      | Similar to Dew Point, but for ice formation.                 | **Winter Safety.** Monitor this in attics or near windows. If $T_{fp}$ is higher than the surface temp, frost will form inside your walls.                                                                                    |
| **Absolute Humidity**      | $g/m^3$ | The actual mass of water vapor in the air volume.            | **Dehumidifier Control.** Unlike RH, which changes with temperature, this tells you the *actual* moisture load. Use it to compare Indoor vs. Outdoor moisture to decide if opening a window will *actually* dry out the room. |
| **Air Enthalpy** ($h$)     | $kJ/kg$ | The total heat energy (sensible + latent) stored in the air. | **Efficiency.** Used to control Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs) or Economizers. It tells you if the outside air actually has less *energy* than inside air, even if the temperature looks okay.                            |
| **Humidex**                | °C      | A "feels-like" temperature combining heat and humidity.      | **Summer Comfort.** Use this to trigger Air Conditioning. High humidity makes $24°C$ feel like $30°C$. $T_{op}$ handles radiant heat; Humidex handles sweat evaporation limits.                                               |
| **Thermal Perception**     | Text    | A human-readable comfort status.                             | **Dashboards.** Outputs states like `"Comfortable"`, `"Sticky"`, or `"Dangerous"`. Great for quick-glance dashboards or sending phone notifications.                                                                          |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Technical Note:** All psychrometric values are calculated using the **Air Temperature** ($T_{air}$), not the Operative Temperature ($T_{op}$). This is because humidity properties are physically bound to the air mass itself, not the radiant environment.

### 🦠 Mold Risk Sensor (Critical Surface Analysis)

Most "mold sensors" just alert you if the room humidity goes above 60%. This is often inaccurate in cold climates because mold doesn't start in the middle of the room—it starts on the coldest surface (thermal bridges, corners, or windows).

The **Virtual Mold Risk Sensor** uses your specific room parameters to calculate the relative humidity **at the surface of your exterior walls**, providing a much more accurate safety metric.

#### How it works
It combines four data points to model the microclimate at your wall's surface:
1.  **Indoor Air & Humidity:** ($T_{air}$, $RH$)
2.  **Outdoor Temperature:** ($T_{out}$ from Weather Entity)
3.  **Insulation Quality:** ($k_{loss}$ from your Configured Profile)

Using the **Insulation Loss Factor** ($k_{loss}$), the integration estimates how much colder your wall surface is compared to the room air. For example, if it is $-20^{\circ}\text{C}$ outside and your insulation is poor, your wall surface might be only $12^{\circ}\text{C}$ even if the room is $21^{\circ}\text{C}$.

#### Risk Levels
The sensor reports the **Surface Relative Humidity** and assigns a risk level icon:

| Surface RH    | Status       | Icon | Meaning                                                                                                                                        |
|:--------------|:-------------|:-----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **< 65%**     | **Low Risk** | 🛡️  | Safe. No action needed.                                                                                                                        |
| **65% - 80%** | **Warning**  | ⚠️   | **Pre-conditions for mold.** The surface is damp enough for spores to settle. You should lower indoor humidity or improve air circulation.     |
| **> 80%**     | **CRITICAL** | ☣️   | **Active Growth Potential.** Conditions are perfect for mold germination on your walls. Immediate ventilation or dehumidification is required. |

> **Why this matters:** In winter, a room at 45% RH might feel dry to you, but if your walls are cold, that same air can cause 90% RH at the wall surface, leading to hidden mold growth behind furniture. This sensor detects that invisible risk.

## 🔌 KNX Integration

The original blueprint included logic to manually push values to a KNX Bus. Since this integration creates standard Home Assistant entities, you now use the native **KNX Integration** to expose these values.

To send the **Mean Radiant Temperature** or **Operative Temperature** to your KNX system (thermostats, displays, etc.), add the following to your `configuration.yaml`.

**Data Point Type:** The integration outputs values compatible with **DPT 9.001** (Temperature °C).

```yaml
# configuration.yaml

knx:
  expose:
    # Expose MRT to KNX
    - type: temperature        # DPT 9.001
      address: "1/0/10"        # Replace with your KNX Group Address
      entity_id: sensor.living_room_mean_radiant_temperature

    # Expose Operative Temperature (T_op) to KNX
    - type: temperature        # DPT 9.001
      address: "1/0/11"        # Replace with your KNX Group Address
      entity_id: sensor.living_room_operative_temperature
